# Project Title Here

This is a test repository for learning about github pages.

## Anything else?

I'm learning about *markdown* right now.

### Is that it?

Any text with no empty lines between will become a paragraph.
Leave a blank line between headings and paragraphs, or where you want to start a new paragraph.

Font can be *Italic* or **Bold**.
Code can be highlighted with `backticks`.

Hyperlinks look like this [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/).

A bullet list is created using *, +, or - like:

- dog
- cat
- muffin

A numbered list is created using a number followed by '.', like:

1. one
2. two
3. three
4. four

You can do 'compressed' content like this:

<details>
<summary> My favourite numbers are</summary>

- one
- two
- three
- four

</details>
